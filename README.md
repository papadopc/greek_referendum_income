Greek Referendum Income analysis

Data from http://ekloges.ypes.gr/ and http://www.gsis.gr/gsis/export/sites/default/gsis_site/PublicIssue/documents_Statistics/statdeltio2011.pdf

Income data in Greece is not very reliable, but hopefully is unreliable in the same way across regions.

Athens, Thessaloniki and Peiraias Prefectures have been normalized to averages for mean income and No vote.

Initial cleaning of data in openoffice format in referendum_results.ods, then exported in referendum_results.csv
